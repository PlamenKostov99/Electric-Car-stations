# Electric Car Stations
# Introduction
This project is a web-based system designed to control electric vehicle charging points. It is developed as part of a Master's thesis in Information Technology.

# Technologies Used
Java: The main programming language used to provide the logic and functionality needed to control the charging points.
PostgreSQL: A powerful open-source relational database system used to manage and store data related to the charging stations and their usage.
SpringBoot: A framework that simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications. It is used to expedite the development process and create a stand-alone, production-grade application.
Thymeleaf: A Java-based library used to create web applications. It provides a way to integrate HTML templates with Spring MVC.
Flyway: An open-source database migration tool that helps to manage and apply changes to the database.
# Project Structure
The project consists of a developed prototype of a web application for controlling electric vehicle charging points. The architecture of the developed prototype, a database diagram, and the structured main components of the web system and the developed prototype form the basis of the project.
